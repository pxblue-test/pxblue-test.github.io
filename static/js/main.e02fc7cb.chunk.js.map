These usually represent a common path that a user is expected to take to complete various tasks. Workflows that are defined in PX Blue are intended to be nearly identical between applications. Examples of very common workflows include the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/patterns/login\"\n      }}>{`login`}</a>{` experience and user registration/sign up.`}</p>\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`Design Patterns`}</h1>\n    <RegularWidth mdxType=\"RegularWidth\">\n    <ImageGrid images={[PatternStatesImg]} gridImageProps={{\n        sm: 12\n      }} mdxType=\"ImageGrid\" />\n    </RegularWidth>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/patterns\"\n      }}>{`Design patterns`}</a>{` are very common in PX Blue.
