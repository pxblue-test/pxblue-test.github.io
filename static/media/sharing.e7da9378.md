# Sharing Code

One of the primary goals of Power Xpert Blue is to eliminate the need for teams to duplicate effort. If you have built something using Power Xpert Blue that you think would benefit other Eaton development teams, we would love to hear from you. Please [Contact us](/community/contactus) and we will make your code available to other Power Xpert Blue adopter teams.

We build our code examples using GitHub and use several online tools for sharing them. These tools allow for importing GitHub repositories and making the code runnable and editable in an online IDE.

- For Angular and Ionic projects, we use [StackBlitz](http://www.stackblitz.com). 
- For React we use [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io).
- For React Native we use [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/). Snack requires that your project is built using the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/).

If you have not used these tools before, they're a great way to play with code and make sharing code snippets much easier. We recommend that you try them out when submitting code samples to speed up the process.

## Our Code

All of the code samples and documentation from this site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue). You can also check out the [Resources](/resources) page for links to the live demos for our examples.
