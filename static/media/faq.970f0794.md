# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How do I update to PX Blue 2.2+ if I'm currently using 2.1?
1. First, delete the PX Blue 2.1 theme files from your project source tree.
2. Next, install the new [@pxblue/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/themes) package from NPM.
3. Update your import statements to point to the npm package instead of the local file.
4. You'll also need to add a line to reference the Open Sans font package (where to add the line varies by framework)

Detailed instructions can be found in our updated Framework Guides. 
* [Angular](/development/frameworks-web/angular)
* [React](/development/frameworks-web/react)

### 2. Can I use Ionic with PX Blue?	
With version 2.3.0, PX Blue introduced support for Ionic applications. While Ionic supports the use of a variety of frameworks for development, at this time PX Blue support is limited to Ionic 4+ applications built using Angular and Angular Material.

### 3. Can I use Bootstrap with PX Blue?
PX Blue does not support the use of Twitter Bootstrap for PX Blue applications. Bootstrap can cause conflicts with PX Blue components and themes and is an unnecessary addition next to the Material component libraries and frameworks supported by PX Blue. If you are accustomed to using Bootstrap for layout, you can read about the PX Blue alternative approach on our [Layout Patterns](/patterns/layout) page.

### 4. Can I use other charting solutions (e.g., D3) with PX Blue?
Currently, PX Blue recommends using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) for your charting needs. If you prefer an open-source charting alternative, PX Blue also offers resources for working with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/). You can read more about this on our [Visualizations](/patterns/visualizations) page. You may use other charting solutions in your application if there is a genuine business need, but keep in mind that this may compromise the consistency and reusability of your solution when compared to other projects.

### 5. Do you have Design Patterns for...?
We will be continuously updating the Design Patterns section of pxblue.github.io with new patterns and code samples as they are ready. We will prioritize patterns and examples based on interest expressed from development teams. If there is something you want to see, [Contact us](/community/contactus). 

If you have built something that you would like to share, check out our information on [Sharing Code](/community/sharing) and [Contact Us](/community/contactus) with a demo.
